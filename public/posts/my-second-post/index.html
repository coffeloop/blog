GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. It has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) with its ability to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. In this post, we will explore what GPT transformers are and some of their current use cases.
What is a GPT Transformer?
GPT transformers are a type of neural network architecture that uses a mechanism called self-attention to process and generate text. They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. The most well-known version is GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters, making it one of the largest and most powerful language models to date.">
